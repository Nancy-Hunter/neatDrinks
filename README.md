## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilizes "The Cocktail DB" API to access 636 unique cocktails. Includes non-alcoholic and standard cocktails. Streamlined, no nonsense user interface.

## Optimizations

Might be helpful to group popular cocktails by alcohol choice. Could extend project by creating a more robust navigational bar. Could improve searchability in include misspelled words. 

## Lessons Learned:

Approaching this with OOP would have been beneficial. Improved next and previous buttons from previous projects.
